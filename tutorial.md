## What is Vector Search?

Imagine you're looking for documents that are "similar" to a query, but not necessarily containing the exact same words. Traditional keyword search would fail here, but vector search excels. Vector search transforms text into high-dimensional numerical representations called embeddings, where semantically similar content appears closer together in vector space.

### Why Vector Search Matters

Traditional search engines rely on exact keyword matching. If you search for "automobile" but your documents contain "car," you'll miss relevant results. Vector search understands that "automobile," "car," "vehicle," and "auto" are semantically related concepts and can find all relevant documents regardless of exact word usage.

### Real-World Example

Consider searching for "machine learning algorithms." Traditional search would only find documents containing those exact words. Vector search would also find documents about:
- "neural networks and deep learning"
- "AI models and classification techniques" 
- "supervised learning methods"
- "pattern recognition systems"

Because these concepts are semantically related, they appear close together in vector space.

## Understanding Embeddings

Embeddings are the heart of vector search. They convert text, images, or other data into numerical vectors (arrays of numbers) that capture semantic meaning.

### How Embeddings Work

1. **Text Processing**: Your text is processed by a pre-trained machine learning model
2. **Vector Generation**: The model outputs a fixed-size array of numbers (typically 384, 768, or 1536 dimensions)
3. **Semantic Representation**: Similar concepts produce similar vectors

### Example Visualization

```
"dog" → [0.2, -0.1, 0.8, 0.4, ...]
"puppy" → [0.3, -0.2, 0.7, 0.5, ...]  # Similar to "dog"
"car" → [-0.5, 0.9, -0.3, 0.1, ...]   # Different from "dog"
```

Notice how "dog" and "puppy" have similar values, while "car" is quite different.

### Popular Embedding Models

- **Sentence Transformers**: Great for general-purpose text embeddings
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: High-quality embeddings with broad knowledge
- **Cohere Embeddings**: Optimized for semantic search tasks
- **BERT-based Models**: Strong understanding of context and language

## Types of Search

Our vector search agent supports three main search types:

### 1. Semantic Search (Dense Vector Search)

Uses dense embeddings to find semantically similar content. This is what most people think of as "vector search."

**Best for:**
- Finding similar concepts regardless of exact wording
- Cross-language search
- Handling synonyms and related terms

**Example:**
- Query: "financial advice"
- Finds: "investment guidance," "money management tips," "economic recommendations"

### 2. Keyword Search (Sparse Vector Search)

Uses sparse vectors that represent exact keyword matches, similar to traditional search but with vector operations.

**Best for:**
- Exact term matching
- Technical documentation search
- When precision is more important than recall

**Example:**
- Query: "Python pandas DataFrame"
- Finds: Documents containing exactly those technical terms

### 3. Hybrid Search

Combines both semantic and keyword search, giving you the best of both worlds. You can adjust the balance between semantic understanding and keyword precision.

**Best for:**
- Most real-world applications
- When you want both conceptual similarity and keyword relevance
- Comprehensive search coverage

**Example:**
- Query: "secure payment processing"
- Finds: Both semantically related content about financial security AND documents containing exact technical terms

## Our Vector Search Agent

Our implementation provides a flexible, production-ready vector search system with clean abstractions that make it easy to work with different vector databases.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo>
cd vector_search

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.search_agent import SearchAgent
from src.vector_store.pinecone_store import PineconeStore

# Initialize the search agent
store = PineconeStore(api_key="your-api-key")
agent = SearchAgent(vector_store=store)

# Create an index
await agent.create_index("my-docs", dimension=384)

# Add documents
documents = [
    {"id": "1", "text": "Python is a programming language", "metadata": {"type": "tech"}},
    {"id": "2", "text": "Machine learning helps solve complex problems", "metadata": {"type": "ai"}}
]
await agent.ingest_documents("my-docs", documents)

# Search for similar content
results = await agent.semantic_search("my-docs", "programming languages", top_k=5)
```

### REST API Usage

```bash
# Start the API server
uvicorn src.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Create an index
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/indexes" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-docs"}'

# Add documents
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/indexes/my-docs/documents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"id": "1", "text": "Sample document", "metadata": {"category": "test"}}]'

# Search
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/indexes/my-docs/search/semantic" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "sample text", "top_k": 5}'
```

## Core Concepts

### Documents
Documents are the basic unit of data in our system:

```python
{
    "id": "unique-identifier",
    "text": "The main content to be searched",
    "metadata": {
        "category": "documentation",
        "author": "John Doe",
        "date": "2024-01-15",
        "tags": ["tutorial", "beginner"]
    }
}
```

### Namespaces
Namespaces provide logical separation within the same index:

- **Multi-tenancy**: Separate data for different users/organizations
- **Data organization**: Separate by document type, source, or time period
- **Access control**: Different permissions for different namespaces

### Metadata Filtering
Powerful filtering using MongoDB-style queries:

```python
# Exact match
{"category": {"$eq": "tutorial"}}

# Multiple values
{"status": {"$in": ["published", "featured"]}}

# Numeric ranges
{"score": {"$gte": 0.8}}

# Complex combinations
{
    "$and": [
        {"category": {"$eq": "tutorial"}},
        {"difficulty": {"$in": ["beginner", "intermediate"]}},
        {"rating": {"$gte": 4.0}}
    ]
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Hybrid Search with Alpha Tuning

Balance between semantic similarity and keyword matching:

```python
# More semantic (alpha=0.7 means 70% semantic, 30% keyword)
results = await agent.hybrid_search("my-docs", "machine learning", alpha=0.7)

# More keyword-focused (alpha=0.3 means 30% semantic, 70% keyword) 
results = await agent.hybrid_search("my-docs", "machine learning", alpha=0.3)
```

### Reranking for Better Results

Improve result quality by reordering search results:

```python
results = await agent.search_with_reranking(
    index_name="my-docs",
    query="artificial intelligence",
    initial_top_k=20,  # Get 20 initial results
    rerank_top_n=5,    # Rerank to get best 5
    rerank_model="bge-reranker-v2-m3"
)
```

### Cascading Search Across Multiple Indexes

Search across multiple indexes and combine results:

```python
results = await agent.cascading_search(
    indexes=["docs", "articles", "papers"],
    query="neural networks",
    rerank_model="pinecone-rerank-v0"
)
```

### Batch Processing

Efficiently process large amounts of data:

```python
# Process 10,000 documents in batches of 100
await agent.batch_ingest_documents(
    index_name="large-corpus",
    documents=large_document_list,
    batch_size=100,
    namespace="batch-2024"
)
```

### Background Tasks

Long-running operations don't block your application:

```python
# The API automatically uses background tasks for large operations
task_id = await agent.ingest_documents_background(index_name, large_documents)

# Check status
status = await agent.get_task_status(task_id)
```

## Real-World Applications

### 1. IAM Policy Generation (Our Main Use Case)

**Scenario**: AWS IAM policy creation from natural language
**Challenge**: Transform vague requirements into secure, production-ready policies
**Solution**: Four-artifact generation with evidence tracking and comparison analysis

```bash
# User request: "S3 read access for web application"
# System generates:
# 1. ReadBack: Human-readable summary with assumptions
# 2. SpecDSL: Machine-readable intent with evidence
# 3. Baseline Policy: Deterministic safe policy
# 4. Candidate Policy: LLM-enhanced policy

python3 examples/iam_policy_agent.py "S3 read access for web application" --artifacts
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Evidence Tracking**: Every decision traced to AWS documentation
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated comparison between safe baseline and enhanced candidate
- **Audit Ready**: Complete provenance and confidence scoring
- **Production Safe**: Always have a deterministic baseline to deploy

### 2. Knowledge Base Search

**Scenario**: Company documentation search
**Challenge**: Employees can't find relevant information quickly
**Solution**: Semantic search understands intent and finds relevant docs regardless of exact wording

```python
# Employee searches for "password reset"
# Finds documents about:
# - "credential recovery procedures"
# - "account access restoration"
# - "login troubleshooting guide"
```

### 3. E-commerce Product Search

**Scenario**: Online store product discovery
**Challenge**: Customers use different terms than product descriptions
**Solution**: Hybrid search combines customer language with exact product specifications

```python
# Customer searches for "warm winter jacket"
# Finds products tagged as:
# - "insulated coat"
# - "thermal outerwear" 
# - "cold weather apparel"
```

### 4. Content Recommendation

**Scenario**: News article recommendations
**Challenge**: Suggest related articles that readers will find interesting
**Solution**: Vector similarity finds articles on related topics

```python
# User reads about "electric vehicles"
# System recommends articles about:
# - "battery technology advances"
# - "sustainable transportation"
# - "automotive industry trends"
```

### 5. Customer Support

**Scenario**: Automated FAQ matching
**Challenge**: Customer questions don't match exact FAQ wording
**Solution**: Semantic search understands customer intent

```python
# Customer asks: "How do I cancel my subscription?"
# Matches FAQ: "Account termination procedures"
# Also finds: "Billing cycle modifications" and "Service cancellation policies"
```

### 6. Research and Academia

**Scenario**: Academic paper discovery
**Challenge**: Finding relevant research across different terminology and domains
**Solution**: Cross-domain semantic search with advanced filtering

```python
# Researcher searches for "neural network optimization"
# Finds papers about:
# - "deep learning performance tuning"
# - "gradient descent improvements"
# - "backpropagation enhancements"
# Filtered by: recent publication date, high citation count
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Index Design

**Choose the Right Dimensions**
- 384 dimensions: Good for most general-purpose tasks, faster and cheaper
- 768 dimensions: Better semantic understanding, standard choice
- 1536+ dimensions: Highest quality but more expensive and slower

**Use Meaningful Index Names**
```python
# Good
"customer-support-articles-2024"
"product-catalog-electronics"
"research-papers-ai-ml"

# Avoid
"index1"
"test"
"data"
```

### 2. Document Preparation

**Optimize Text Content**
```python
# Good: Clean, focused content
{
    "text": "Pinecone is a vector database designed for machine learning applications. It provides fast similarity search and supports real-time updates.",
    "metadata": {"source": "documentation", "section": "overview"}
}

# Avoid: Too short or too long
{
    "text": "Pinecone",  # Too short, no context
    "text": "..." # 10,000 word document - too long, loses focus
}
```

**Structure Metadata Effectively**
```python
# Good: Consistent, searchable metadata
{
    "category": "tutorial",           # Use standardized categories
    "difficulty": "beginner",        # Consistent difficulty levels
    "tags": ["python", "api"],       # Relevant, specific tags
    "created_date": "2024-01-15",    # Standardized date format
    "author_id": "user123"           # Use IDs for consistency
}
```

### 3. Search Optimization

**Use Appropriate Search Types**
```python
# Semantic search for conceptual queries
await agent.semantic_search("docs", "how to improve performance")

# Keyword search for exact terms
await agent.keyword_search("docs", "API endpoint /v1/search")

# Hybrid search for best of both
await agent.hybrid_search("docs", "Python performance optimization", alpha=0.6)
```

**Implement Progressive Search**
```python
# Start with precise search
results = await agent.semantic_search("docs", query, top_k=10)

# If not enough results, broaden the search
if len(results) < 5:
    results = await agent.hybrid_search("docs", query, alpha=0.4, top_k=20)

# Use reranking for final refinement
if len(results) > 10:
    results = await agent.search_with_reranking("docs", query, initial_top_k=20, rerank_top_n=10)
```

### 4. Performance Optimization

**Batch Operations**
```python
# Batch document ingestion
await agent.batch_ingest_documents(
    index_name="large-dataset",
    documents=documents,
    batch_size=100,  # Adjust based on document size
    namespace="production"
)
```

**Use Namespaces Wisely**
```python
# Good: Logical separation
"user-123-documents"     # Per-user separation
"public-knowledge-base"  # Public vs private content
"archived-2023"          # Time-based separation

# Avoid: Too many small namespaces
# This creates management overhead
```

**Monitor and Optimize**
```python
# Regular health checks
health = await agent.health_check()
if health["status"] != "healthy":
    # Handle issues

# Monitor search performance
stats = await agent.get_index_stats("my-docs")
print(f"Total documents: {stats['total_count']}")
print(f"Index utilization: {stats['index_fullness']}")
```

### 5. Production Considerations

**Error Handling**
```python
try:
    results = await agent.semantic_search("docs", query)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Search failed: {e}")
    # Fallback to simpler search or cached results
    results = await fallback_search(query)
```

**Monitoring and Observability**
```python
# Use the built-in health monitoring
app.add_middleware(HealthCheckMiddleware)

# Log search queries for analysis
logger.info(f"Search query: {query}, results: {len(results)}, latency: {latency}ms")
```

**Security Considerations**
```python
# Validate input
if len(query) > 1000:
    raise ValueError("Query too long")

# Sanitize metadata filters
safe_filter = sanitize_filter(user_filter)

# Use namespaces for access control
user_namespace = f"user-{authenticated_user_id}"
```

### 6. Cost Optimization

**Choose Appropriate Vector Stores**
- **Pinecone Serverless**: Pay-per-use, auto-scaling, great for variable workloads
- **Pinecone Pods**: Dedicated resources, predictable costs, better for steady workloads
- **Qdrant**: Self-hosted option for cost control and data sovereignty

**Optimize Embedding Costs**
```python
# Cache embeddings for repeated content
if query in embedding_cache:
    embedding = embedding_cache[query]
else:
    embedding = generate_embedding(query)
    embedding_cache[query] = embedding

# Use smaller models when appropriate
# 384-dim models are often sufficient and much cheaper than 1536-dim
```

**Smart Indexing**
```python
# Only index what you need to search
if document.metadata.get("searchable", True):
    await agent.ingest_documents(index_name, [document])

# Use TTL for temporary data
await agent.upsert_documents(
    index_name, 
    documents, 
    metadata={"expires_at": datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30)}
)
```
